## Problem 6: Capitalize Strings
1. Task: Write a function named `capitalize` that takes a string as input and returns the same string converted to uppercase. Use the Array .map() method to achieve this by treating the string as an array of characters.
2. Task: Create a function named `swapCase` that takes a string of words and alternates the case of each word using the capitalize function you previously created. The function should use .map() to apply capitalization to every other word starting from the second word.
3. Write test cases to verify that the function works as expected.
```ts
    const swapCase = (str: string)=>{
        // Your code here
    } // will return "hello WORLD"
```
