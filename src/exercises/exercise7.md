## Problem 7: Utilisation

1 .Function to Insert Dashes Between Even Numbers: Create a function that takes a numerical input and inserts dashes ('-') between consecutive even numbers. For example, given the input 025468, the output should be 0-254-6-8.

2. Count Comedy Genre Movies: Write code to count how many movies in the movieData array are categorized under the genre "Comedy".

3. Filter Movies by Genre: Extract from movieData a list of movies where the genre includes either "Comedy" or "Fantasy".

4. Function to Remove an Element from an Array: Develop a function that removes a specified element from an array. For instance, calling removeElement([2, 5, 9, 6], 5) should return [2, 9, 6].

5. Function to Check Array for a Specific Element: Implement a function named contains that checks whether a given array includes a specified element. For example, contains([1, 2, 3, 4], 3) should return true.

6. Write tests for the functions you have created in this exercise.
